# About me:
I’m ***Donnerinoern***, better known as **Donnan**. A Norwegian IT-student with ADHD. I'll be done with my bachelor's degree spring 2024. Been using Linux as my main OS since fall 2021. Currently using NixOS.
I have experience with the following languages:
- Java
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Kotlin
- C#
- Ruby
- SQL
- HTML/CSS (obviously)

and the following frameworks:
- Ruby on Rails
- Svelte/SvelteKit
- React
- Firebase
- Jetpack Compose

I also have a fairly decent understanding of Linux and Linux-distributions.

As of right now, my main focus is on learning lower-level languages with manual memory managment. C++ is on the agenda, and I'll follow up with either Rust or Zig. I haven't quite decided yet. I'm also planning on learning Go as a replacement for Java.

You can reach me on Discord (donnan) for now, and on mail in the near future...
